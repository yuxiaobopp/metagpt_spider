# Data Interpreter (DI)

## What is Data Interpreter
Data Interpreter is an agent who solves data-related problems through codes. It understands user requirements, makes plans, writes codes for execution, and uses tools if necessary. These capabilities enable it to tackle a wide range of scenarios, please check out the examples below. For overall design and technical details, please see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18679).

## Example List
- Data visualization
- Machine learning modeling
- Image background removal
- Solve math problems
- Receipt OCR
- Tool usage: web page imitation
- Tool usage: web crawling
- Tool usage: text2image
- Tool usage: email summarization and response\
- More on the way!

Please see the [docs](https://docs.deepwisdom.ai/main/en/guide/use_cases/agent/interpreter/intro.html) for more explanation.

We are continuously releasing codes, stay tuned!
